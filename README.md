# Global-super-store-Sales-Analysis
# Overview

This project involves analyzing sales data from a global superstore with branches all over the world. The analysis focuses on cleaning the data, visualizing sales trends, and providing insights into shipping methods, sales by geographical regions, and top-performing cities. The analysis is done using Power BI to create interactive visualizations and reports that allow stakeholders to explore sales data dynamically.

# Objectives

### 1.	Data Cleaning:
* Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
* Ensure correct data types for analysis (e.g., dates, numeric values). 
### 2.	Visualizations:
*	Segment visuals by country, region, and market to allow comparisons across different geographical locations.
*	Analyze shipping mode to understand the percentage of sales attributed to different shipping methods.
*	Create detailed sales reports across cities, states, regions, and markets.
*	Highlight the top five cities by sales using a donut chart.
*	Add a year filter for dynamic analysis over time.

### 3.	Interactive Sales Report:   
*	Combine visuals and filters to create an interactive dashboard.
*	Allow stakeholders to slice the data based on years, regions, and markets.

### Visuals and Reports

**Donut Chart:** Displays the top five cities by sales, sales by region and market.

**Slicers:**  Provide filters for country, state, city and year, enabling stakeholders to explore data by specific dimensions.

**Bar Charts:**  Show sales across different cities, states, and markets for easy comparison.

**Donut Chart:** Illustrates the percentage breakdown of shipping modes (e.g., standard, expedited).

**Maps:** Geographically display sales distribution to visualize market penetration across Countries.

### Advantages
1.	Interactive Visuals:
*	Power BI’s slicers and filters allow users to explore data interactively, making it easier to find insights without being constrained by static reports.
2.	Dynamic Time Analysis:
*	With the year slicer, users can view sales trends over different periods, offering a temporal perspective on the business’s growth or decline.
3.	Geographical Segmentation:
*	The segmentation by country, region, and market allows for an in-depth understanding of performance in different geographic locations.
  
4.	Top City Sales Insight:
*	By focusing on the top five cities, stakeholders can quickly identify key markets driving sales, helping inform decisions about resource allocation.
5.	Shipping Mode Efficiency:
*	The analysis of sales by shipping mode gives stakeholders insight into customer preferences and logistical efficiency, which can guide shipping strategy improvements.

### Limitations
**1.	Data Quality Dependence:**
*	The accuracy of the analysis relies heavily on the quality of the input data. Incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent data can affect the results of the analysis.
**2.	Limited Historical Context:**
*	The year slicer allows analysis by year, but if the dataset does not include enough historical data, it may not provide a long-term trend analysis.
**3.	Geographical Focus:**
*	While the report segments data by country, region, and market, the analysis may miss smaller, hyper-local trends within cities or states.
**4.	Static Top 5 Analysis:**
*	The donut chart highlighting the top five cities is useful but static. If the stakeholders want to see more cities or different rankings, they need to adjust the filter or request additional visualizations.
**5.	Performance in Power BI:**
*	For very large datasets, Power BI might experience performance issues, especially if complex filters and visuals are applied. Optimization might be required for real-time reporting.

### Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the global superstore's sales data, offering detailed insights into geographical performance, shipping modes, and top markets. The interactive report empowers stakeholders to explore the data dynamically, making it an excellent tool for decision-making. However, it’s essential to maintain data quality and consider expanding the analysis for longer-term trends and deeper insights into smaller regions.
